## 1. Introduction  
* The repository shows the data analysis of Cholera disease which is killing people for last two centuries and shows the evidence that if the countries doesn't have access to clean drinking water or sanitation or doesn't have basic healthcare infrastructure then Cholera can kill thousands of people if not millions.  

![Top-12 Countries With Most Cholera Cases Reported](https://github.com/strikersps/Cholera-Disease-Analysis/blob/main/Cholera-Cases-Top-12-Countries.png)  
* The above graphs shows the Top-12 Countries with the most reported Cholera Cases (1949-2016) and it is evident that India and Bangladesh which had half a million cases reported in the late 1940s have now relatively very less number of cases/deaths reported due to the vaccination and sanitation avaialbility but in most of the African countries Cholera is still a major threat to the people due to very weak and fragile healthcare infrastructure present in these countries (Refer the below figure).

* The goal of this project is to create awareness and to understand the spread of Cholera disease globally using R progarmming language and also what measures we can take to eradicate the disease which is killing people since 1850's by developing the required healthcare infrastructure and accessibility to clean drinking water and vaccines.

## 2. About Dataset  
* The dataset consists of information about the total number of cases, deaths and fatality rate (CFR) for the cholera disease from 1949-2016.  
* The dataset is downloaded from the [WHO Global Health Observatory Data Repository](https://apps.who.int/gho/data/node.resources) website which tracks the disease outbreaks globally.
